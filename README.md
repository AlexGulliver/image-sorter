# Python Image Sorter
This is a python image sorting script. It uses a TKinter GUI. 

## Usage
Direct the script to desired folder path that contains images you wish to sort. The images will be sorted in place into a YEAR / MONTH folder format. Currently the script only supports .jpeg / .jpg. 

## TODO
- Add support for other image formats.
