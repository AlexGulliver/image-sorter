# Python Image Sorter
This is a python image sorting script. The script creates a tosort/ folder (if it does not already exist) in the working directory. You can currently place .jpeg image files in this folder and they will be sorted into /YEAR/MONTH/ folders based on their metadata. There is currently not support for other image file types - planned to add later. 

## TODO
- TKinter GUI interface (TKinter branch)
- Testing, check with multiple image formats
- Add support for .MOV files
